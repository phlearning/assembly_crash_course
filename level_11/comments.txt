We'll assume the initial value of rdi is 0x3307c427, as given in the problem statement.

Initial state:
rdi = 0x3307c427
rax = unknown (we don't know its initial value)

Step 1: xor rax, rax
This sets rax to 0.
rdi = 0x3307c427
rax = 0x0000000000000000

Step 2: and rdi, 1
This operation keeps only the least significant bit of rdi.
rdi = 0x0000000000000001 (because 0x3307c427 is an odd number, its least significant bit is 1)
rax = 0x0000000000000000

Step 3: xor rdi, 1
This flips the least significant bit of rdi.
rdi = 0x0000000000000000 (1 XOR 1 = 0)
rax = 0x0000000000000000

Step 4: xor rax, rdi
This XORs rax with rdi, which effectively copies the value of rdi to rax.
rdi = 0x0000000000000000
rax = 0x0000000000000000

Final state:
rdi = 0x0000000000000000
rax = 0x0000000000000000

In this case, the input (0x3307c427) was an odd number, so the final result in rax is 0, which correctly implements the logic:
if x is even then
y = 1
else
y = 0
If we had started with an even number in rdi, the final value of rax would have been 1.
